- üëã Hi from GenerativeAI4Finance team!! You have been using OpenAI & chatGPT for Text, & Audio. How cool is to build a "Generative AI platform for Finance" from scratch!
  Kind of Jarvis from Iron Man exclusively for Finance. Jarvis Avatar for users, IT professionals, Bankers and everyone needing or using Finance.
  You read it right.
  Totally from scratch - Right from a foundational model to different forms of prompts, co-pilots,
  tools It's Generative AI for use cases in Lending, Investment Banking, Trading, Banking as a Service and so on.
  And later expanding to Wealth management & Asset Management. We will build our own technology stack, tools from scratch.
- üëÄ Let's collect use cases, set of tools, AI infra already available and so on.
- üå± Let's start from a "Hello World" but then build something remarkable for the World.
- üíûÔ∏è Let your imagination and coding skills come together. Start from the use cases you think should be built. Think of Co-Pilots for various roles.

  # Generative AI Illustrative Architecture
  This is not complete but just examplary. Certain improvements need to be done and are known.
  These may be done in upcoming versions.
