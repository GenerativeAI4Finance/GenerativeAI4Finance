  tools It's Generative AI For use cases in Lending, Investment Banking, Trading, Banking as a Service and so on.
  And later expanding to Wealth management & Asset Management. We will build our own technology stack, tools from scratch.
- 👀 Let's collect use cases, set of tools, AI infra already available and so on.
- 🌱 Let's start from a "Hello World" but then build something remarkable for the World.
