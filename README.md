üëã Hi from the GenerativeAI4Finance team!

- You have been using OpenAI & chatGPT for Text & Audio, Video, Code & Images.
- How about Financial Data & Decision Making? Let's build a GenerativeAI 4 Finance that does that. And it's built from scratch.

# What is this about?
GenerativeAI 4 Finance consists of following parts

### Foundational models for finance (Refer vs-neev repository)
- üå± Large Foundational models built from scratch. Which are pre-trained and can be used for several use cases across Lending, Investment Banking, Wealth, Asset Management. 
   (Refer vs-neev repository)
### High level reusable components (Refer vs-tantra repository)
- üíûÔ∏è Necessary for domain specific solutions 
### Examples of Co-Pilots and applications
- üì´ Co-Pilots(Kind of like Jarvis from Iron Man) for every one using finance. Eg. Co-Pilot for borowwers and lenders providing suggestions 

# What is the need?
- Existing core technologies in Generative AI are around content and its variations, but not for Financial Data & Decision making.
- Framework for quickly building domain specific platform does not exist. Frameworks provided by BigTech are fairly low level. As an analogy - If BigTech's framework was python, GenerativeAI4Finance is Pandas.
- Enterprises and MSMEs need their more specific implementations than Generalized ones provided.
  -  Eg. An Enterprise would want its knowledge base to queried in natural language only for its internal purposes and its own specific customizations
  -  Another example a small business would want an integeration with CRM for its sales leads.
  
# Mission
- People - AI should benefit all. Vaayushop has started focus on MSMEs. GenerativeAI 4 Finance must expedite its benefits to all levels of society.
- Propserity - AI will generate a lot of new wealth. However use cases must bring collaboration between Corporates & different parts of society. So benefits are shared.
- Planet - A productivity increase with innovation reduces net footprint on planet.

We will build our technology stack, tools from scratch.

# How are Vaayu & GenerativeAI 4 Finance related?
Vaayushop is focused on use cases for Lending & will be involved in building foundational models and core frameworks.
It will be making some parts of its code as open-source.
