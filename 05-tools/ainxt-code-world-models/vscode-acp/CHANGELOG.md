## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `vscode-acp/.vscodeignore` — prevents `webview-ui/node_modules` from being bundled
  into the `.vsix`, reducing package size from ~30 MB / 7000+ files to ~708 KB / 17 files.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — CI pipeline covering lint, compile, extension tests,
  `npm audit`, `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES --check`, `.vsix` packaging, and a mermaid
  render-check job. All third-party Actions pinned to a release commit SHA.
- `package-lock.json` (root) and `vscode-acp/webview-ui/package-lock.json` — lockfiles
  committed and their `.gitignore` exclusion removed for reproducible installs.

### Fixed
- **License consistency**: completed the MIT migration — `vscode-acp/package.json`
  `license` field, both READMEs' license badge/section/disclaimer text, and 7 stale
  `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0` headers (`extension.ts`, `ProfileLoader.ts` ×2,
  `App.tsx`, and 4 IntelliJ Kotlin files) all corrected to MIT.
- **`scripts/generate-third-party-notices.mjs`**: added awareness of the hand-maintained
  "PART II — INTELLIJ" section so regeneration no longer silently deletes it; `--check`
  now passes; CRLF normalised before comparison so Windows checkouts don't produce false
  diffs. IntelliJ component count derived from the preserved table rather than hardcoded.
- **`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES` / `vscode-acp/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES`**: clarified that
  `compliance/` is intentionally gitignored and not a missing deliverable.
- **`hosts/intellij/.../WebviewScheme.kt`**: added `..`-segment check on the classpath
  resource path built from the raw request URL (CWE-23).
- **`.nvmrc`**: updated `20` → `22` to match `package.json` `engines.node`.
- **`README.md`**: removed broken `AINxt_logo_icon/AINxt_CTC-02.png` dark-mode banner
  reference; corrected `SECURITY.md` row description.
- **`docs/README.md`**: corrected offline-capability claim — `docs/index.html` vendors
  `mermaid`/`marked` locally and makes no CDN requests.
- **`GOVERNANCE.md`**: pointed "current maintainers" at `MAINTAINERS.md` instead of
  `CODEOWNERS`.
- **`vscode-acp/package.json`**: removed `"copilot"` from marketplace keywords.

### Removed
- Orphaned flat `docs/*.md` tree (32 files) plus `docs/module_tree.json`,
  `docs/first_module_tree.json`, `docs/metadata.json` — superseded by the structured
  `docs/extension/`, `docs/webview/`, and `docs/intellij/` trees.

## [Unreleased] — Licence change to MIT (2026-09-01)

### Changed
- **The project licence is now MIT, replacing Apache-2.0.** `LICENSE` carries the MIT
  text with the existing copyright holder unchanged (National Payments Corporation of
  India); `package.json` `license` is now `"MIT"`; the 52 first-party source files
  carry `SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`. This supersedes the `license` entry recorded
  under *OSS Readiness (2026-08-12)* below, which is left in place as the historical
  record of what happened at that point.
- `NOTICE`: the trademark section no longer reasons from Apache-2.0 §6. It states the
  position under MIT, which is silent on trademarks rather than carving them out. All
  attributions are unchanged.

### Unchanged — deliberately
- **Third-party licences.** The Apache-2.0 components in `NOTICE` and
  `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES` — `@agentclientprotocol/sdk`, TypeScript, the IntelliJ
  Platform SDK, Gson, the Kotlin standard library — remain under their own licences.
- **The Gradle wrapper scripts** (`hosts/intellij/gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`) keep their
  Apache-2.0 headers. They are Gradle Inc.'s code, not this project's.

### Note for adopters
Apache-2.0 §3 granted an express patent licence. **MIT contains no patent grant.**
Rights in the copyrighted work are unchanged, and MIT is otherwise the more permissive
licence, but downstream recipients no longer receive that express patent grant.

## [Unreleased] — Newcomer setup audit (2026-08-29)

Findings carry `SETUP-0xx` identifiers from the release-readiness audit ledger, which
is maintained **outside this repository** and is not published with it. The identifiers
are kept here so a future reader can correlate a change with its finding.

### Added
- `install.sh` / `install.ps1` — one-command install for macOS/Linux and Windows:
  detects the IDE, obtains the extension (published release, else source build),
  installs it, sets `ainxt.gatewayUrl`, then **probes the gateway** and reports
  `auth/me`, `budget/me` and `complete` individually. `--verify` re-checks
  connectivity; `--uninstall` removes the extension.
- `setup.sh` — the one-command source build the README had documented, including its
  `--check` and `--install` flags, but which was never committed (SETUP-039).
- `vscode-acp/.vscodeignore` — the `.vsix` was 30 MB / 7009 files, 6921 of them
  `webview-ui/node_modules`; it is now 708 KB / 17 files (SETUP-043).
- `scripts/check-release-invariants.sh` — 10 checks for properties a fresh clone
  depends on, each tied to a finding and negative-tested.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — the repo had no CI, while CONTRIBUTING required
  `npm test`, which could not run (SETUP-042, SETUP-052).
- `src/test/acpRoundTrip.test.ts` + `src/test/fixtures/stub-acp-agent.js` — no test
  had ever exercised a subprocess or the JSON-RPC wire. Now covers spawn →
  `initialize` → `session/new` → `session/prompt` → streamed `session/update`, with
  no gateway, model or credentials (SETUP-052).
- Two regression tests for session ordering and cap eviction under tied timestamps.

### Fixed
- **`SessionHistoryStore.list()` returned sessions oldest-first on a timestamp tie.**
  `lastActiveAt` has millisecond resolution and `Array.sort` is stable, so
  same-millisecond entries kept insertion order — inverting the documented contract.
  `enforceCap()` evicts from that same ordering, so it could delete the *newest*
  session and keep a stale one. Tie-break added on `createdAt` then insertion index.
  Found only because the test suite became runnable for the first time (SETUP-050).
- **`npm test` could not start**: `@vscode/test-electron ^2.4.1` resolved to 2.5.2,
  which looks for `Contents/MacOS/Electron` — a path VS Code ≥1.110 no longer uses.
  Bumped to `^3.1.0` (SETUP-042).
- **The Gradle wrapper JAR was excluded by a blanket `*.jar` ignore**, so `./gradlew`
  could not bootstrap and the IntelliJ plugin was unbuildable from a clone
  (SETUP-040).
- **No lockfile was published** (`package-lock.json` was gitignored by name), so no
  external install was reproducible — the direct cause of SETUP-042 (SETUP-041).
- `ainxt.autocomplete` posts to `/ainxt/v1/api/complete`, which the AiNxt Platform
  does not implement; the failure was silent. A `404`/`501` now logs one explanatory
  line per gateway URL, and the limitation is documented (SETUP-056).
- Untracked `hosts/intellij/.intellijPlatform/self-update.lock`; added
  `.intellijPlatform/` and `.kotlin/` to `.gitignore` (SETUP-049).

### Changed
- Build Node floor raised 20 → 22 in `.nvmrc`, `engines.node` and `setup.sh`: the
  toolchain (`@vscode/vsce`, `@vscode/test-electron`) declares `node >=22`, and Node 20
  produced `EBADENGINE` for eleven packages. Build-time only — `engines.vscode` stays
  `^1.85.0` (SETUP-055).

### Documentation
- `hosts/intellij/README.md` stated the plugin "does not build as cloned" and that no
  Gradle build script or wrapper was committed, calling it a release blocker. Both are
  committed; `./gradlew buildPlugin` succeeds. Rewritten against a verified build
  (SETUP-044).
- `vscode-acp/README.md` told newcomers to `cd ainxt-ide-plugin/vscode-acp`, a
  directory that does not exist (SETUP-045).
- Documented `acp.agents` and `ainxt.registryUrl` — 9 of 11 settings had been listed,
  and the missing one governs outbound egress to a public CDN (SETUP-051).
- `SECURITY.md` gained an explicit inventory of the three requests the plugin makes on
  its own account, and how to keep the registry lookup inside a perimeter.
- Fixed dead links to `GOVERNANCE.md` and a root `CHANGELOG.md`; corrected the
  repository layout, which listed an `archive/` and a root `config/` that do not exist;
  surfaced the 39-page `docs/` tree, previously referenced by nothing (SETUP-046).
- `docs/overview.md` still called the repo `ainxt-ide-plugin-develop`;
  `docs/session_management_history.md` described the old eviction order;
  `docs/extension_activation.md` claimed a gateway→Ollama path a stock Platform lacks.
- Noted that `code` is not on `PATH` by default on macOS, with both workarounds
  (SETUP-048).
- Single Node floor, asserted by CI rather than restated in three places (SETUP-047).

- `src/config/AgentConfig.ts`: Added `ainxt.homeDir` support; `AINXT_HOME` passed to agent spawn env; added `resolveAinxtHome()` helper.
- `src/core/ConnectionManager.ts`: ACP client identifier read from `package.json` `name` field.
- `src/extension.ts`: Removed `localhost:8000` fallback; improved error messages; corrected `sendEvent` extension ID; all credential reads use `resolveAinxtHome()`.
- `src/ui/ChatWebviewProvider.ts`: Removed `localhost:8000` fallback.
- `webview-ui/src/App.tsx`: Removed NPCI hostname from Connect form placeholder; removed "NPCI budget" from tooltip; dynamic welcome subtitle with 3-step onboarding; gateway hostname in identity chip tooltip.
- `webview-ui/package.json`: Removed `version` field.
- `src/test/extension.test.ts`: Extension ID corrected to `ainxt.ainxt-vscode`; expanded to 5 suites / 15 tests.
